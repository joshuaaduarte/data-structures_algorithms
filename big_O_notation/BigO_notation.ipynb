    "Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we need a two-dimensional array of size nxn, this will require O(n^2) space\n",

    "* If your algorithm is in the form 'do this, then, when you're all done, do that' then add the runtimes. \n",
    "* If your algorithm is in the form 'do this for each time you do that' then multiply the runtimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space get halved each time, that will likely be a O(log N) runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have a recursive function that makes multuple calls, the runtime will often (but not always) look like O(branches^depth), where the branches is the number of times each recursive call branches. In this case, this gives us O(2^n).\n"
